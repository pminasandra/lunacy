# Lunacy: a personalised radio channel

Lunacy is a hobby-project to listen to my favourite podcasts in a different way.
Lunacy takes a list of podcast RSS feeds and transforms it into a daily radio channel, complete with
anchors and continuity announcers powered by OpenAI's Large Language Models.

## Personal project
While this is largely meant for my own sake, to learn as well as enjoy audio content better, I want to
try to make this a generally usable bit of code so that you can listen to your own podcasts in the same
way.

I also decided to try to use ChatGPT to help write the code to see how it compares to usual coding standards.
The answer: if you care about style and readability, abysmal.
However, it is undeniable that the software really speeds up things, so what can we do?
